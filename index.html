                  You’ve probably been hearing a lot about “AI” (Artificial Intelligence) lately. It might sound complicated or futuristic, like something out of a science fiction movie. But what if we told you that AI is something you can start using today, right here in Park City, to make your life easier, more creative, and more fun?
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">So, What is an "AI Mindset"?</h2>
                <p>
                  Simply put, developing an "AI Mindset" isn't about becoming a programmer or a tech expert.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-indigo-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-800">
                  It’s about learning to think of AI as a helpful, creative partner—a copilot—that you can talk to.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Imagine having a personal assistant who is an expert in almost everything. You could ask it to help you plan a hike, come up with a new recipe for dinner, or even help you write a poem about the beauty of the Wasatch mountains. That's the AI Mindset in action: knowing what you can ask for and how to ask for it.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What It's Not</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>It's not about memorizing facts.</strong> AI is your new expert for that.</li>
                  <li><strong>It's not about being "tech-savvy."</strong> If you can send an email, you can use AI.</li>
                  <li><strong>It's not a replacement for human connection.</strong> It's a tool to give you more time and ideas, so you can connect with others even more.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  In this series, we'll show you how to get started, step-by-step. You'll be surprised at how easy and enjoyable it can be.

                <p>
                  For the last 20 years, we've all become experts at using search engines like Google. When you need to find a fact, a website, or a piece of information, you type in a few keywords and get a list of links. It's like looking up a topic in the index of a giant encyclopedia.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Search is for Finding. AI is for Creating.</h2>
                <p>
                  This is the most important difference. A search engine is designed to <span class="font-bold">find</span> existing information on the internet. An AI Chatbot, on the other hand, is designed to <span class="font-bold">create</span> something new, just for you.
                </p>

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-6">

                  </div>
                  <div class="p-4 bg-indigo-50 rounded-lg border border-indigo-200">

                    <p>You ask: "Can you give me a healthy dinner recipe that uses chicken, spinach, and tomatoes, and takes less than 30 minutes to prepare?"</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">It gives you: A brand new recipe, created just for you, with a shopping list and step-by-step instructions, all in one place.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">It's a Conversation, Not a Command</h2>
                <p>
                  With a search engine, you type in your keywords and you're done. With AI, it's a back-and-forth conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using our recipe example, after the AI gives you the recipe, you could continue the conversation:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                  <li>"That sounds great, but can you make it gluten-free?"</li>
                  <li>"What's a good side dish to go with that?"</li>
                  <li>"Can you make this recipe for six people instead of two?"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  You can refine, adjust, and explore ideas with AI in a way that's simply not possible with a traditional search engine. You are in the driver's seat of the conversation.

                  Now it’s time for the fun part! Let's have your first conversation with an AI. We are going to use a simulated AI right here on this page. It won't be connected to the internet, but it will give you a feel for how it works.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Think of a Question</h2>
                <p>
                  Remember, you're not just searching for facts. You're starting a conversation. Try to ask something that requires a bit of creativity or planning. For our example, let's pretend we're interested in local history.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Write Your Prompt</h2>
                <p>
                  A "prompt" is simply what you write to the AI. Let's type a prompt into the box below. Try something like: <span class="italic">"I'm new to Park City and interested in its history. What's a good way to start exploring it?"</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Look at that! The AI didn't just give you a link. It gave you a direct suggestion and even offered a creative follow-up idea (a walking tour). This is the power of the AI Mindset. Your job is now to continue the conversation. You could ask:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li>"Yes, please create a historical walking tour of Main Street."</li>
                    <li>"How long does it take to tour the museum?"</li>
                    <li>"Are there any other historical sites nearby?"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You're in control of the discovery process.</p>

                  Now that you’ve had a practice conversation, let's learn a few simple tips to get even better results from an AI. Writing a "prompt" is the single most important skill for using AI, and the good news is, it’s just like having a good conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You don't need special code or technical language. You just need to be clear and provide good context.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Tip 1: Give it a Role</h2>
                <p>
                  One of the best ways to get better responses is to tell the AI who it should be. This helps it understand the tone and type of information you’re looking for.
                </p>
                <div class="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border mt-4">
                  <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Tell me about hiking trails."</p>

                  The more details you give the AI, the better it can tailor the response to you. Think about the 'who, what, where, when, why' of your request.
                </p>
                <div class="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border mt-4">
                  <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Give me a recipe."</p>
                  <p class="mt-2"><strong>Try:</strong> "Give me a recipe for a vegetarian dinner. I have about 45 minutes to cook, and I have bell peppers, onions, and quinoa in my pantry. I'd like something healthy but flavorful."</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Tip 3: Tell it the Format You Want</h2>
                <p>
                  Do you want a list? A paragraph? A table? You can tell the AI exactly how to structure its answer.
                </p>
                <div class="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border mt-4">
                  <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "What are some book clubs in Park City?"</p>
                  <p class="mt-2"><strong>Try:</strong> "Please give me a list of book clubs in Park City. For each one, put it in a table with columns for the club name, the genre of books they read, and their meeting schedule."</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Tip 4: Don't be Afraid to Follow Up</h2>
                <p>
                  Your first prompt is just the beginning. If the AI’s response isn't quite right, just tell it! Use follow-up prompts to refine the answer.

                  Park City is a paradise for hikers, with countless trails to explore. But sometimes, planning a hike can be almost as challenging as the hike itself! This is where your AI copilot can shine.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Planning the Perfect Hike</h2>
                <p>
                  Instead of spending hours searching different websites for trail information, you can simply ask your AI to do the planning for you. Remember to provide good context!

                  This is where AI image generation tools (like Midjourney, DALL-E, or Gemini's image generator) come in. These tools can turn your words into images. This is perfect for when you have an idea but can't quite visualize it.

                    "A watercolor painting of a quiet aspen grove in Park City during the autumn. The style should be soft and impressionistic, with golden light filtering through the yellow leaves."

                  The AI will create several unique images based on your description. You can use these as direct inspiration for your own painting, or you can refine the prompt to explore different styles and compositions.
