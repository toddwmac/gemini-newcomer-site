    Park City is a paradise for hikers, with countless trails to explore. But sometimes, planning a hike can be almost as challenging as the hike itself! This is where your AI copilot can shine.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Planning the Perfect Hike</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of spending hours searching different websites for trail information, you can simply ask your AI to do the planning for you. Remember to provide good context!
  </p>
  <div class="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border mt-4">
    <p class="font-semibold">Example Prompt:</p>
    <p class="mt-2 italic">
      "You are a friendly and experienced Park City hiking guide. I want to go for a hike this Saturday morning. There are two of us, and we are beginner-to-intermediate hikers. We’d like a trail that is around 3-4 miles long, has beautiful views of the aspens, and is not too crowded. Please suggest 3 different trails and put them in a table with columns for Trail Name, Difficulty, Length, and a brief description of the view."</p>
  </div>
  <p class="mt-4">
    The AI will then generate a perfectly formatted table for you, making it easy to compare your options. No more jumping between ten different browser tabs!

  <p>
    Many AI tools now have the ability to see and understand images. This is a game-changer for hikers. If you have an AI app on your phone (like Gemini or Google Lens), you can take a picture of a plant or flower and ask the AI to identify it.
