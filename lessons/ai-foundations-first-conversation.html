<div class="prose lg:prose-xl">
  <p>
    Now it’s time for the fun part! Let’s have your first conversation with an AI. We are going to use a simulated AI right here on this page. It won’t be connected to the internet, but it will give you a feel for how it works.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Think of a Question</h2>
  <p>
    Remember, you’re not just searching for facts. You’re starting a conversation. Try to ask something that requires a bit of creativity or planning. For our example, let’s pretend we’re interested in local history.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Write Your Prompt</h2>
  <p>
    A “prompt” is simply what you write to the AI. Let’s type a prompt into the box below. Try something like: <span class="italic">"I’m new to Park City and interested in its history. What’s a good way to start exploring it?"</span>
  </p>

      <div class="flex flex-col">
          <textarea
              class="w-full p-2 border rounded-md"
              rows="3"
              placeholder="Type your prompt here..."

          <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">AI Response:</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700" id="first-conversation-response-text"></p>
      </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Read and Continue the Conversation</h2>
  <p>
    Look at that! The AI didn’t just give you a link. It gave you a direct suggestion and even offered a creative follow-up idea (a walking tour). This is the power of the AI Mindset. Your job is now to continue the conversation. You could ask:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
      <li>"Yes, please create a historical walking tour of Main Street."</li>
      <li>"How long does it take to tour the museum?"</li>
      <li>"Are there any other historical sites nearby?"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You’re in control of the discovery process.</p>
