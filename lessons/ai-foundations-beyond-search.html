  <p>
    For the last 20 years, we’ve all become experts at using search engines like Google. When you need to find a fact, a website, or a piece of information, you type in a few keywords and get a list of links. It’s like looking up a topic in the index of a giant encyclopedia.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Search is for Finding. AI is for Creating.</h2>
  <p>
    This is the most important difference. A search engine is designed to <span class="font-bold">find</span> existing information on the internet. An AI Chatbot, on the other hand, is designed to <span class="font-bold">create</span> something new, just for you.

      <p>You ask: "healthy dinner recipes"</p>
      <p class="mt-2">It gives you: A list of links to existing recipe websites. You then have to click through them, read the recipes, and decide which one works for you.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-center mb-2">AI Conversation</h3>
      <p class="text-center text-sm mb-4">(You are a Creative Partner)</p>
      <p>You ask: "Can you give me a healthy dinner recipe that uses chicken, spinach, and tomatoes, and takes less than 30 minutes to prepare?"</p>
      <p class="mt-2">It gives you: A brand new recipe, created just for you, with a shopping list and step-by-step instructions, all in one place.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">It’s a Conversation, Not a Command</h2>
  <p>
    With a search engine, you type in your keywords and you’re done. With AI, it’s a back-and-forth conversation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using our recipe example, after the AI gives you the recipe, you could continue the conversation:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
    <li>"That sounds great, but can you make it gluten-free?"</li>
    <li>"What’s a good side dish to go with that?"</li>
    <li>"Can you make this recipe for six people instead of two?"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can refine, adjust, and explore ideas with AI in a way that’s simply not possible with a traditional search engine. You are in the driver’s seat of the conversation.
